DBOS is a serverless platform that radically simplifies backend development. You want to build your next application with DBOS because:

- **It's reliable by default**.  If your workflows are interrupted for any reason, they [will always resume from where they left off](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/workflow-tutorial#reliability-guarantees).  Reliable message delivery is [built in](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/workflow-communication-tutorial#reliability-guarantees-1). Idempotency is [built in](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/idempotency-tutorial).
- **It's simple**.  Write your business logic with serverless functions and either [self-host them](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/self-hosting) or [deploy them to DBOS cloud](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart#deploying-to-dbos-cloud) in minutes. Store your data in any PostgreSQL-compatible database&mdash;we'll manage the transactions for you.
- **It makes debugging easy**.  With our [time travel debugger](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/timetravel-debugging), you can "rewind time" and replay any DBOS Cloud trace locally on your computer, exactly as it originally happened.
